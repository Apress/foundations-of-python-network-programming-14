You can learn more about the book by visiting the

These scripts were written for Python 3, but can also run successfully
under Python 2.  Simply use [3to2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2) to
convert them to the older syntax.

The scripts in this chapter are best exercised inside the network
[Playground](../../playground#readme) where `mail.example.com` is
already set up and configured to receive incoming email.  Once the
playground is running, ask for a prompt on the `h1` host and visit the
`chapter13` directory:

    $ ./play.sh h1

    # cd py3/chapter13

At the `h1` machine’s prompt you can then experiment with sending
messages across the network.  The `simple.py` script and the slightly
more advanced `ehlo.py` do their work silently, while `debug.py` asks
the Standard Library to show the communication that is going on at the
socket level.

```
$ python3 simple.py mail.example.com sender@example.com brandon@example.com
Message sent to 1 recipient
```

```
$ python3 ehlo.py mail.example.com sender@example.com brandon@example.com
Maximum message size is 10240000
Message sent to 1 recipient
```

```

After connecting to the `mail` machine with the username `brandon` and
the password `abc123` you can use the venerable `mail` command to see
that three new test messages are in your mailbox, thanks to the three
Python scripts that you just ran:

    # ssh brandon@mail.example.com
    brandon@mail.example.com's password: abc123

    You have new mail.

    $ mail
    "/var/mail/brandon": 6 messages 6 new

The `login.py` and `tls.py` scripts are for the more advanced cases
where an SMTP server requires authentication or TLS encryption —
situations for which the Playground SMTP server is not yet configured.
