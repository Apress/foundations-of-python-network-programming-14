# Chapter 12<br>Building and Parsing E-Mail

This is a directory of program listings from Chapter 12 of the book:

Third Edition, October 2014<br>
by Brandon Rhodes and John Goerzen

You can learn more about the book by visiting the
[root of this GitHub source code repository](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp#readme).

The scripts in this chapter work only in Python 3.4 and later, because
they take advantage of several innovations in the Standard Library
`email` module that have been recently introduced by R. David Murray.
If you are stuck on an older version of Python 3 then you will want to
visit the [`pre-python-3.4`](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp/tree/m/py3/chapter12/pre-python-3.4)
subdirectory, where you can find the examples from the Second Edition of
the book updated for Python 3.  The original Python 2 examples are in
the [`py2/chapter12`](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp/tree/m/py2/chapter12)
directory of this source code repository.

The simplest script builds an email message, which the book takes as a
basic example of what email looks like on the wire or when saved in a
raw form to disk by a mail spool or client.

```
$ python3 build_basic_email.py > mail.txt
```

```
$ cat mail.txt
To: recipient@example.com
From: Test Sender <sender@example.com>
Subject: Test Message, Chapter 12
Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 19:20:08 -0400
Message-ID: <20140325232008.15748.50494@guinness>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello,
This is a basic message from Chapter 12.
 - Anonymous
```

An email client will typically hide most of these details from the user.
The `display_email.py` script is offered as an example of the kind of
information that the user might want to see when they view a message.

```
$ python3 display_email.py < mail.txt
From: Test Sender <sender@example.com>
To: recipient@example.com
Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 19:20:08 -0400
Subject: Test Message, Chapter 12

Hello,
This is a basic message from Chapter 12.
 - Anonymous

```

From these simple beginnings, the book progresses through more and more
complicated examples of MIME encoding until it has explained alternative
parts, related parts, and attachments.  All of these features can be
seen interacting in a single message by giving `build_mime_email.py`
exactly the right arguments:

```
$ python3 build_mime_email.py -i attachment.txt attachment.gz > mail.txt
```

```
$ cat mail.txt

The book then shows how this complexity is hidden from a typical email
user by invoking both the `display_email.py` script and also the more
low-level investigative `display_structure.py` script to look at the
email’s structure in fine details.  These scripts can also be used to
unravel complicated real-world emails from the reader’s own mailbox.

```
$ python3 display_email.py < mail.txt
From: Test Sender <sender@example.com>
To: Test Recipient <recipient@example.com>
Date: Tue, 25 Mar 2014 19:20:08 -0400
Subject: Foundations of Python Network Programming

Hello,

* image/gif attachment named 'blue-dot.gif': bytes object of length 35
* text/plain attachment named 'attachment.txt': str object of length 15
* application/octet-stream attachment named 'attachment.gz': bytes object of length 33
```

```
$ python3 display_structure.py < mail.txt
 type=multipart/mixed
.0 type=multipart/alternative
.0.0 type=multipart/related
.0.0.0 type=text/html str len=215
.0.0.1 type=image/gif bytes len=35 attachment filename='blue-dot.gif'
.0.1 type=text/plain str len=59
.1 type=text/plain str len=15 attachment filename='attachment.txt'
.2 type=application/octet-stream bytes len=33 attachment filename='attachment.gz'
```

Finally, one last script lets the reader learn about how Unicode comes
into play when it appears in email headers and when it appears in the
body of an email.  Encoding is necessary in both cases, because neither
context traditionally allows anything except plain ASCII printable
characters.

```
$ python3 build_unicode_email.py > mail.txt
```

```
$ cat mail.txt

examples, as well as for further information about the options with
which you can invoke them.
